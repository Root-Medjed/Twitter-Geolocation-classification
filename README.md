# Twitter-Geolocation-classification

In the past decades, the percentage of social media users grew rapidly. It has brought the attention that huge amount of information extracted from textual content on social medias such as Twitter can bring gigantic benefits to the society.

This project aims to explore the effectiveness of several Machine Learning models including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine and Logistic regression classifers among data set derived from the resource published by [Eisenstein et al., 2010], which is composed of three sets: train and develop-ment sets with labels which are used for training and evaluating the models; and the test set which is unseen and without labels used for the final evaluation of the models.
